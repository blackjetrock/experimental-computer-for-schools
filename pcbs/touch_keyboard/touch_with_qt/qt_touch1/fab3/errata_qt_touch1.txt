QT Touch keyboard Errata
========================

1. CS_N should be CS_N_3V3
2. TX and RX are swapped on the jumpers. Not a problem.
3. CS_N and CS_N_3V3 are different signals
4. SS on QT IC is not connected, so internal pull-up is used.
5. TP8 X is not connected.
6. A and RUN have the same X and Y onnections
