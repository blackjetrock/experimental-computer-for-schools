By the line, most code and tests will be written by AI in the next few years, with humans specifying it, checking it and checking the overall results.

The next generation will look back and ask, "you wrote code BY HAND ?" the same way 99% of us look back and ask "you wrote assembly code BY HAND ?" (and by the numbers, 99% of us don't manage memory by hand, either)

The first computer I was exposed to was an IBM Schools Computer. It had no assembler. It booted into what in retrospect I suppose was a primitive memory debugger; you toggled machine code into the box as hex bytes.
